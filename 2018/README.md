My 2018 submissions are a bit more of a hodge-podge than 2016.
In 2016, I tried to make things nice and orderly, with specs and everything.
In 2018, I've just hacked it - using quick functions, no tests unless they seem helpful,
and a lot of trial and error.

This worked for the first few. We'll see if more structure is needed as we get further along.
